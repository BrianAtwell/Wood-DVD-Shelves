# Wood-DVD-Shelves
I made some Shelves in FreeCAD to fit the space at the bottom of my stairs. It uses common square edge boards except a few custom width pieces. The bottom is deeper to improve stability. The shelves are 8" between shelves to fit DVD/blueray and custom cases.

There are two shelves, a short and a tall one.

## Tall Shelf
The tall shelf has seven shelves each 2' 10" wide. The overall dimensions are 2' 11" wide by 5' 5+3/4" high.

## Short Shelf
The short shelf has four shelves each 3' 5" wide. The overall dimensions are 3' 6+1/2" wide by 3' 3+3/4" high.
